Version: 1.0.6
----------------
Date: 2011-04-27

Version: 1.0.5

Date: 2011-02-19

- bug correction: the role foreign key is now created by using the Inflector class to be correctly generated even for camelcased role model names
- bug correcton: updated the way the roles and users display names are configured to prevent some situations where the use of an existing database field 
  was not possible. It also improves performance by creating new virtual fields only if necessary.
